## My process

Trial and error when it came to developing this solution.  I'm still struggling with knowing the "best" way of constructing a layout.  "Why is this margin not working!?", "Should I use grid?", etc.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- CSS Grid
- CSS Modules

### What I learned

Always start with the responsive layout, not necessarily just mobile first (Polypane was a massive help).

Micro-fiddling to achieve pixel-perfect layouts is like chasing rainbows and a massive time-suck.  I got to what I believe is a very close approximation (Polypane's image overlay really helped).    

Creates everything as a component helped with intellectually manageability.

SASS/SCSS is really useful, but I need to figure out the best way of using it.

Practice, practice, practice.
